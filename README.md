# LpDB

LpDB is a lightweight software solution to manage your record collection and help you answer the question, "Do I already own this?" quicker as you're out riffling through records. Additionally, you can track how many times you have spun a particular record, add in notes, and document various details. This project is my very first implementation of a full stack application and was created for my server side capstone project for Thinkful. LpDB is powered by the incredible DiscogsAPI, MongoDB, and Javascript from the front to the back end.
